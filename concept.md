We need to build a scorecard for 10 frames
each frame has 2 rolls.
If 10 pins striked in 1st roll - the frame finishes, and the number of pins striked in next two rolls added to the score
if 10 pins total in 2 rolls of 1 frame (6+4), number of pins striked in next roll added to the score

it "lets player enter 1 roll"
how do we save it?

we have one roll, we will get another.
we should save these in an array? 
an array of arrays? With each array having 2 elements(2 rolls per frame)
and create a scorecard where the total of these two is saved
